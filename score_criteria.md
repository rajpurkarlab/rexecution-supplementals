# Supplemental Table 3. Scoring criteria explicitly stating value definitions to ensure thorough, consistent, and reproducible assessment.

## Process

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 | All relevant anatomical areas and findings were thoroughly and explicitly considered. No important area or type of finding was overlooked. |
| 4 | Most relevant areas and findings were considered, but one minor omission or less explicit coverage. |
| 3 | Several relevant areas or findings were omitted, but the response still partially addressed the core diagnostic space. |
| 2 | Only limited or superficial areas were considered. Key anatomical zones/findings relevant to the question were missed. |
| 1 | The model clearly misunderstood the intention or focused entirely on irrelevant areas/findings. |

## Execution

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 | No hallucinations or omissions. All reported findings (or "normal" area descriptions) are accurate, well-grounded, and appropriately described. No bias. |
| 4 | One minor hallucination or omission, not affecting clinical interpretation. Potential confirmation bias. |
| 3 | Some findings are correct, but one major or multiple minor hallucinations/omissions present. Probable confirmation bias. |
| 2 | Several inaccurate or ungrounded findings that distort the interpretation. Definite confirmation bias. |
| 1 | The findings are mostly fabricated, irrelevant, or contradict the image context entirely. |

## Synthesis

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 | Excellent clinical reasoning. Logical interpretation of findings with appropriate hedging. |
| 4 | Generally sound reasoning with minor simplifications or assumptions. No major logical flaws. |
| 3 | Reasoning has gaps, is overly confident or uncertain, or shows major simplification. |
| 2 | Poor clinical reasoning, misinterprets findings, or applies logic that doesn’t follow. |
| 1 | No real reasoning shown or clearly flawed/incoherent logic throughout. |

## Language

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 | Excellent clarity and precision in phrasing, free of ambiguity. |
| 4 | Generally clear, with only minor awkwardness or potential misinterpretation. |
| 3 | Somewhat unclear or imprecise phrasing; reader may need to infer part of the meaning. |
| 2 | Frequently ambiguous or misleading phrasing; important details are obscured. |
| 1 | Very confusing or incorrect language; meaning is lost or distorted. |

## Image Content

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 | All boxes are precisely placed and correctly labeled. Locations match anatomical targets, and labels match findings with high fidelity. |
| 4 | One minor inaccuracy in location (e.g., off by a small margin) or slight label ambiguity, but overall the markings are sound. |
| 3 | Some boxes are accurate, but there are one or two moderately misplaced boxes or unclear/misleading labels. |
| 2 | Several inaccuracies in either box placement or labeling; only one or two boxes are correct. |
| 1 | Boxes and/or labels are largely incorrect or misleading, such that the viewer cannot rely on them for image understanding. |

## Image Style

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 | All annotations directly reflect and support the findings in the text. No hallucinated, missing, or excessive boxes. |
| 4 | One minor inconsistency (e.g., a missing box for a minor finding) that doesn’t affect interpretation. |
| 3 | Multiple moderate issues: some findings not boxed, or some boxes appear unrelated to the main answer. |
| 2 | Many boxes do not align with the text, include irrelevant regions, or miss critical findings entirely. |
| 1 | Most boxes are irrelevant, hallucinated, or missing. The annotations add confusion rather than support the textual answer. |
